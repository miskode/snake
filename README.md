# Snake Game for Web
This is just a little project I made in my spare time and is programmed very badly. If you did want to run it for some reason, download the files, run "index.html" and enjoy. Or you could just go to [https://miskode.github.io/snake](https://miskode.github.io/snake). 
I've also added a few customization features to spice things up slightly. There are **endless** possibilities! (Like making the background, snake, and apple all black so you have to guess where you are, but who would do something silly like that?)
Enjoy!
