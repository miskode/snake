# Snake Game for Web
This is just a little project I made in my spare time and isn't really anything special. If you did want to run it for some reason, download the files, run "index.html" and enjoy.
I've also added a few customization features to spice things up slightly. There are **endless** possibilities! (Like making the background, snake, and apple all black so you have to guess where you are, but who would do something silly like that?)
Enjoy!
